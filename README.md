# J34 Bot

This is a bot which connects to the MQTT server of the Laundry Learn projects and sends Telegram messages to every user, who registers with `/start`. You can unregister with `/stop`.

Until now a message is sent when the laundry machine starts and one when it ends.

The bot is available at `@j34Bot`
